# master_thesis_RBM20_DCM
This repository contains all code that was written and used for the master thesis 'On- and Off-Target Activity of Therapeutic CRISPR Base Editing for Familial Dilated Cardiomyopythy' by Leonie KÃ¼chenhoff. The thesis was done at the EMBL in the lab of Prof. Dr. Steinmetz under the supervision of Dr. Shengdi Li.

## DNA

### 1. /variant_calling
Pre-processing of the raw fastq files into called variants (.vcf).  
#### Steps:
##### 1. Install and activate conda environment
mamba env create -p ./envs/smake -f ./envs/environment.yaml  
conda activate ./envs/smake
##### 2. Prepare input and configuration files
inputs/input.yaml  
inputs/samples.txt  
inputs/fasta/mm10_AAV.fa.gz ### reference genome  
inputs/fasta/mm10_AAV.bed ### bed file containing chromosomal lengths required for scalpel  
inputs/vcf/*.vcf.gz ### known sites for BQSR,VQSR and lofreq  
##### 3. Run snakemake
snakemake --profile ./profile  

#### 2. /variantfile_preparation
Steps following variant calling. Includes snakemake workflow to normalize, filter, and merge vcf files from differnt tissues and variant callers into one txt file. Can be run from the same environment as the variant calling part. Therefore, call 
conda activate ./envs/smake

##### a) snakefile  
    - Snakemake workflow  
##### b) /scripts  
    i) vcf_to_AFtable.pl  
        Transforms vcf files to txt table for easier data handling.  
    ii) db_entry_overlap.py  
        Script to extract overlapping sites with sites annotated in databases. Also corrects genotype of duplicated alleles.  
Returns trimmed database entry files with only entries overlapping with sample variants.  
    iii) create_filter_tables.py  
        Script to perform quality filtering and save filtered variants  
    iv) table_annovar.pl  
        Script to add genome annotation to variants.  

#### 3. /variant_analysis
Analysis of serveral aspects of output files from step two.
config.py - directory settings for import statements. Most import files are created in step 2.  
a) variant_caller_venn.ipynb  
    Plot venn diagrams of variants called by different variant callers.  
b) tissue_spec_list.ipynb  
    Write one list per tissue of tissue specific variants. Output needed for AF.ipynb & variant_surrounding.ipynb  
c) AF.ipynb  
    Plot total number of tissue specific and common variants  
    Plot allele frequency of A to G mutations  
    Plot allele frequency of on-target edits  
d) annotation.ipynb  
    Plot how variants are annotated (intron vs. exon etc.), caluclate fraction per category, sample and tissue.  
e) SNP_type.ipynb  
    Calculate fraction of SNP per sample and tissue and categorize into type of SNP, plot results.  
f) variant_surrounding.ipynb  
    For each tissue specific variant, the following things will be checked:  
    Is it an A>G mutation?  
    Are there any gRNA Sequence similarities around the variant?  
g) semi_global_alignment.pl  
    Helper scrip that is called in variant_surrounding.ipynb. Searches for Seqeuence similarities of two sequences and  
    returns number of mismatches of best match.





## RNA
### calling_prep
Pre-processing of the raw fastq files into variant files (.vcf). Also includes some steps following variant calling, such as filtering, normalization and merging them into a common txt file.
Can be run from the same environment as the DNA variant calling part. However certain rules of the snakemake pipeline require python 2.7, which is run from a separate environment. 
##### 1. Install python 2.7 conda environment. 
mamba env create -p ./envs/smakep27 -f ./envs/env_p27.yml \\
The pipeline is run from the same evironment as the DNA pipeline. The p27 environment will be called withing the snakemake pipeline. Therefore, run: \\
conda activate ../DNA/variant_calling/envs/smake
##### 2. Run the snakemake pipeline
If all samples with the P635L mutation should be run, call: \\
snakemake -s snakefile --profile profile --use-conda --config mutation=p635l \\
If all samples with the R636Q mutation should be run, call: \\
snakemake -s snakefile --profile profile --use-conda --config mutation=r636q \\

### analysis
This folder cotains all costum made scripts to analyze variants.
It has the following files:

#### Python scripts and jupyter notebooks

- config.py
Paths that are used several times in scripts. Are imported at start of most scripts
- config.sh
Paths that are used several times in bash scripts.

- tissue_spec_list.ipynb
Write one list per tissue of tissue specific variants (with anntation in which other samples these variant occur)

- filter_mgp_variants.ipynb
Filter mgp db entries based on their annotations. Variants of interest are only protein coding variants.
